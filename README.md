# üó∫Ô∏è Elevation-Based Route Planner

A Python project that calculates hiking or cycling routes based on elevation data. Originally designed to find paths that are either the most direct or have the least elevation gain ‚Äî ended up being an exercise in debugging, API issues, and emotional resilience.

## Goal

- Use OpenStreetMap data to generate route graphs
- Incorporate elevation data to calculate elevation gain along paths
- Implement DFS traversal to explore different routing options
- Visualize routes using `folium`, with elevation markers

## Tech Stack

- Python
- OSMnx (OpenStreetMap data)
- folium (interactive map rendering)
- elevation API (aka the pain source)
- networkx

## Challenges

- Buggy API responses that failed silently
- Broken DFS due to stack behavior vs expected route sorting
- Paths not connecting properly on maps
- Elevation markers either not rendering or showing up in the wrong location
- Spent more time debugging than coding

## Wins

- Got route visualization working (after days of crying)
- Custom marker rendering for elevation gain/loss
- Learned way too much about why map data hates me

## What I Learned

- Graph traversal and route planning aren‚Äôt just about algorithms ‚Äî visualization, data accuracy, and clean structure matter  
- Stack vs queue behavior in DFS has real consequences  
- I am capable of debugging things I don‚Äôt understand until they somehow work

## Status

Emotionally complete. Technically functional.
